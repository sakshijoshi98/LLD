//Key Highlights:
//Threads are created dynamically if none are idle.
//Fast, short-lived tasks (email sending) benefit most.
//Threads are reused if they become idle within a short time.
//Always call shutdown() to clean up resources.
//Thread pools increase performance and avoid system overloading caused by excessive thread creation.
