//Key Highlights:
//Only 5 threads work concurrently — others wait in queue.
//Simulates a limited-resource scenario (like physical counters).
//Tasks are queued and picked up by idle threads after processing.
//Always call shutdown() to clean up resources.
//Thread pools increase performance and avoid system overloading caused by excessive thread creation.
